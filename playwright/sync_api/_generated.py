        Request that was redirected by the server to this one, if any.

        When the server responds with a redirect, Playwright creates a new `Request` object. The two requests are connected
        by `redirectedFrom()` and `redirectedTo()` methods. When multiple server redirects has happened, it is possible to
        construct the whole redirect chain by repeatedly calling `redirectedFrom()`.

        **Usage**

        For example, if the website `http://example.com` redirects to `https://example.com`:

        ```py

            JSON response. This method will set the content type to `application/json` if not set.
        path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            File path to respond with. The content type will be inferred from file extension. If `path` is a relative path,
            then it is resolved relative to the current working directory.
        content_type : Union[str, None]
            If set, equals to setting `Content-Type` response header.
        response : Union[APIResponse, None]
            `APIResponse` to fulfill route's request with. Individual fields of the response (such as headers) can be

        **Details**

        Note that `headers` option will apply to the fetched request as well as any redirects initiated by it. If you want
        to only apply `headers` to the original request, but not to redirects, look into `route.continue_()`
        instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : Union[str, None]
            If set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one.
        method : Union[str, None]
            If set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST).
        headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            If set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.
        post_data : Union[Any, bytes, str, None]
            Allows to set post data of the request. If the data parameter is an object, it will be serialized to json string
            and `content-type` header will be set to `application/json` if not explicitly set. Otherwise the `content-type`
            header will be set to `application/octet-stream` if not explicitly set.
        max_redirects : Union[int, None]
            Maximum number of request redirects that will be followed automatically. An error will be thrown if the number is
            exceeded. Defaults to `20`. Pass `0` to not follow redirects.
        max_retries : Union[int, None]
            Maximum number of times network errors should be retried. Currently only `ECONNRESET` error is retried. Does not
            retry based on HTTP response codes. An error will be thrown if the limit is exceeded. Defaults to `0` - no retries.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Request timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.

        """Route.fallback

        Continues route's request with optional overrides. The method is similar to `route.continue_()` with the
        difference that other matching handlers will be invoked before sending the request.

        **Usage**

        When several routes match the given pattern, they run in the order opposite to their registration. That way the
        last registered route can always override all the previous ones. In the example below, request will be handled by
        the bottom-most handler first, then it'll fall back to the previous one and in the end will be aborted by the first
        registered route.

        ```py
        page.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.abort())  # Runs last.
        page.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.fallback())  # Runs second.
        page.route(\"**/*\", lambda route: route.fallback())  # Runs first.
        ```

        Registering multiple routes is useful when you want separate handlers to handle different kinds of requests, for
        example API calls vs page resources or GET requests vs POST requests as in the example below.

        ```py
        # Handle GET requests.
        def handle_get(route):
            if route.request.method != \"GET\":
                route.fallback()
                return
          # Handling GET only.
          # ...

        # Handle POST requests.
        def handle_post(route):
            if route.request.method != \"POST\":
                route.fallback()
                return
          # Handling POST only.
          # ...

        page.route(\"**/*\", handle_get)
        page.route(\"**/*\", handle_post)
        ```

        One can also modify request while falling back to the subsequent handler, that way intermediate route handler can
        modify url, method, headers and postData of the request.

        ```py
        def handle(route, request):
            # override headers
            headers = {
                **request.headers,
                \"foo\": \"foo-value\", # set \"foo\" header
                \"bar\": None # remove \"bar\" header
            }
            route.fallback(headers=headers)

        page.route(\"**/*\", handle)
        ```

        Use `route.continue_()` to immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be
        invoked in that case.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : Union[str, None]
            If set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one. Changing the URL won't affect the
            route matching, all the routes are matched using the original request URL.

        Sends route's request to the network with optional overrides.

            # override headers

            route.continue_(headers=headers)

        page.route(\"**/*\", handle)
        ```

        **Details**

        The `headers` option applies to both the routed request and any redirects it initiates. However, `url`, `method`,
        and `postData` only apply to the original request and are not carried over to redirected requests.

        `route.continue_()` will immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be
        invoked. Use `route.fallback()` If you want next matching handler in the chain to be invoked.

        **NOTE** The `Cookie` header cannot be overridden using this method. If a value is provided, it will be ignored,
        and the cookie will be loaded from the browser's cookie store. To set custom cookies, use
        `browser_context.add_cookies()`.

        `key` can specify the intended
        [keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) value or a single character
        to generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
        [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

        `F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
        `Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`,
        etc.

        Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`,
        `ControlOrMeta`. `ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

        Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

        If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective
        texts.

        If `key` is a modifier key, `Shift`, `Meta`, `Control`, or `Alt`, subsequent key presses will be sent with that
        modifier active. To release the modifier key, use `keyboard.up()`.

        After the key is pressed once, subsequent calls to `keyboard.down()` will have
        [repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/repeat) set to true. To release the key,
        use `keyboard.up()`.

        **NOTE** Modifier keys DO influence `keyboard.down`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

        Parameters

        ```py

        Since `eventInit` is event-specific, please refer to the events documentation for the lists of initial properties:
        - [DeviceMotionEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/DeviceMotionEvent)
        - [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent/DeviceOrientationEvent)

        Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

        If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective

    def bounding_box(self) -> typing.Optional[FloatRect]:
        """ElementHandle.bounding_box

        This method returns the bounding box of the element, or `null` if the element is not visible. The bounding box is
        calculated relative to the main frame viewport - which is usually the same as the browser window.

        Scrolling affects the returned bounding box, similarly to
        [Element.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).
        That means `x` and/or `y` may be negative.

        Elements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the
        [Element.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).

        Assuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input. For example, the
        following snippet should click the center of the element.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        box = element_handle.bounding_box()
        page.mouse.click(box[\"x\"] + box[\"width\"] / 2, box[\"y\"] + box[\"height\"] / 2)

        This method captures a screenshot of the page, clipped to the size and position of this particular element. If the
        element is covered by other elements, it will not be actually visible on the screenshot. If the element is a
        scrollable container, only the currently scrolled content will be visible on the screenshot.

        This method waits for the [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks, then scrolls element into view before taking
        a screenshot. If the element is detached from DOM, the method throws an error.

        Returns the buffer with the captured screenshot.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        type : Union["jpeg", "png", None]
            Specify screenshot type, defaults to `png`.
        path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            The file path to save the image to. The screenshot type will be inferred from file extension. If `path` is a
            relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. If no path is provided, the image
            won't be saved to the disk.
        quality : Union[int, None]
            The quality of the image, between 0-100. Not applicable to `png` images.
        omit_background : Union[bool, None]
            Hides default white background and allows capturing screenshots with transparency. Not applicable to `jpeg` images.
            Defaults to `false`.
        animations : Union["allow", "disabled", None]
            When set to `"disabled"`, stops CSS animations, CSS transitions and Web Animations. Animations get different
            treatment depending on their duration:
            - finite animations are fast-forwarded to completion, so they'll fire `transitionend` event.
            - infinite animations are canceled to initial state, and then played over after the screenshot.

            Defaults to `"allow"` that leaves animations untouched.
        caret : Union["hide", "initial", None]
            When set to `"hide"`, screenshot will hide text caret. When set to `"initial"`, text caret behavior will not be
            changed.  Defaults to `"hide"`.
        scale : Union["css", "device", None]
            When set to `"css"`, screenshot will have a single pixel per each css pixel on the page. For high-dpi devices, this
            will keep screenshots small. Using `"device"` option will produce a single pixel per each device pixel, so
            screenshots of high-dpi devices will be twice as large or even larger.

            Defaults to `"device"`.
        mask : Union[Sequence[Locator], None]
            Specify locators that should be masked when the screenshot is taken. Masked elements will be overlaid with a pink
            box `#FF00FF` (customized by `maskColor`) that completely covers its bounding box. The mask is also applied to
            invisible elements, see [Matching only visible elements](../locators.md#matching-only-visible-elements) to disable
            that.
        mask_color : Union[str, None]
            Specify the color of the overlay box for masked elements, in
            [CSS color format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). Default color is pink `#FF00FF`.
        style : Union[str, None]
            Text of the stylesheet to apply while making the screenshot. This is where you can hide dynamic elements, make
            elements invisible or change their properties to help you creating repeatable screenshots. This stylesheet pierces
            the Shadow DOM and applies to the inner frames.

            - `'detached'` - wait for element to not be present in DOM.
            - `'visible'` - wait for element to have non-empty bounding box and no `visibility:hidden`. Note that element
              without any content or with `display:none` has an empty bounding box and is not considered visible.
            - `'hidden'` - wait for element to be either detached from DOM, or have an empty bounding box or
              `visibility:hidden`. This is opposite to the `'visible'` option.
        timeout : Union[float, None]

        strict : Union[bool, None]

        """Accessibility.snapshot

        Captures the current state of the accessibility tree. The returned object represents the root accessible node of
        the page.

        **NOTE** The Chromium accessibility tree contains nodes that go unused on most platforms and by most screen
        readers. Playwright will discard them as well for an easier to process tree, unless `interestingOnly` is set to
        `false`.

        **Usage**

        An example of dumping the entire accessibility tree:

        ```py
        snapshot = page.accessibility.snapshot()
        print(snapshot)
        ```

        An example of logging the focused node's name:

        ```py
        def find_focused_node(node):
            if node.get(\"focused\"):
                return node
            for child in (node.get(\"children\") or []):
                found_node = find_focused_node(child)
                if found_node:
                    return found_node

        snapshot = page.accessibility.snapshot()
        node = find_focused_node(snapshot)
        if node:
            print(node[\"name\"])
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        interesting_only : Union[bool, None]
            Prune uninteresting nodes from the tree. Defaults to `true`.
        root : Union[ElementHandle, None]
            The root DOM element for the snapshot. Defaults to the whole page.

        Returns the main resource response. In case of multiple redirects, the navigation will resolve with the response of

        - there's an SSL error (e.g. in case of self-signed certificates).
        - target URL is invalid.
        - the `timeout` is exceeded during navigation.

        `response.status()`.

        **NOTE** The method either throws an error or returns a main resource response. The only exceptions are navigation
        to `about:blank` or navigation to the same URL with a different hash, which would succeed and return `null`.

        **NOTE** Headless mode doesn't support navigation to a PDF document. See the

        This method waits for the frame to navigate to a new URL. It is useful for when you run code which will indirectly

        is considered a navigation.

        ```py
        a_window_handle = frame.evaluate_handle(\"Promise.resolve(window)\")
        a_window_handle # handle for the window object.
        ```

        A string can also be passed in instead of a function.

        ```py
        a_handle = page.evaluate_handle(\"document\") # handle for the \"document\"
        ```

        `JSHandle` instances can be passed as an argument to the `frame.evaluate_handle()`:

        ```py
        a_handle = page.evaluate_handle(\"document.body\")
        result_handle = page.evaluate_handle(\"body => body.innerHTML\", a_handle)
        print(result_handle.json_value())
        result_handle.dispose()
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        expression : str
            JavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context. If the expression evaluates to a function, the
            function is automatically invoked.
        arg : Union[Any, None]

        Wait for the `selector` to satisfy `state` option (either appear/disappear from dom, or become visible/hidden). If

        **Usage**

        This method works across navigations:

        ```py
        from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

        def run(playwright: Playwright):
            chromium = playwright.chromium

            browser.close()

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to query for.
        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        state : Union["attached", "detached", "hidden", "visible", None]
            Defaults to `'visible'`. Can be either:
            - `'attached'` - wait for element to be present in DOM.
            - `'detached'` - wait for element to not be present in DOM.
            - `'visible'` - wait for element to have non-empty bounding box and no `visibility:hidden`. Note that element
              without any content or with `display:none` has an empty bounding box and is not considered visible.
            - `'hidden'` - wait for element to be either detached from DOM, or have an empty bounding box or
              `visibility:hidden`. This is opposite to the `'visible'` option.

        ```py

        - [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/WheelEvent)

        You can also specify `JSHandle` as the property value if you want live objects to be passed into the event:

        If `expression` returns a [Promise], then `frame.eval_on_selector_all()` would wait for the promise to resolve
        and return its value.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        divs_counts = frame.eval_on_selector_all(\"div\", \"(divs, min) => divs.length >= min\", 10)
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to query for.
        expression : str
            JavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context. If the expression evaluates to a function, the
            function is automatically invoked.
        arg : Union[Any, None]
            Optional argument to pass to `expression`.

           the element is detached during the checks, the whole action is retried.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.

            used.
        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        delay : Union[float, None]
            Time to wait between `mousedown` and `mouseup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
        button : Union["left", "middle", "right", None]
            Defaults to `left`.
        click_count : Union[int, None]
            defaults to 1. See [UIEvent.detail].
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            Actions that initiate navigations are waiting for these navigations to happen and for pages to start loading. You
            can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as

        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard
            `modifiers` will be pressed regardless of `trial` to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys

        This method waits for an element matching `selector`, waits for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks,
        focuses the element, fills it and triggers an `input` event after filling. Note that you can pass an empty string
        to clear the input field.

        If the target element is not an `<input>`, `<textarea>` or `[contenteditable]` element, this method throws an
        error. However, if the element is inside the `<label>` element that has an associated
        [control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/control), the control will be filled
        instead.

        To send fine-grained keyboard events, use `locator.press_sequentially()`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to search for an element. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be
            used.
        value : str
            Value to fill for the `<input>`, `<textarea>` or `[contenteditable]` element.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            This option has no effect.
            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.

        The method returns an element locator that can be used to perform actions on this page / frame. Locator is resolved
        to the element immediately before performing an action, so a series of actions on the same locator can in fact be
        performed on different DOM elements. That would happen if the DOM structure between those actions has changed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to use when resolving DOM element.
        has_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When
            passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, `"Playwright"` matches
            `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.
        has_not_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element.
            When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.
        has : Union[Locator, None]
            Narrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example,
            `article` that has `text=Playwright` matches `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.

            Inner locator **must be relative** to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not
            the document root. For example, you can find `content` that has `div` in
            `<article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>`. However, looking for `content` that has `article
            div` will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the `content`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        has_not : Union[Locator, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the
            outer one. For example, `article` that does not have `div` matches `<article><span>Playwright</span></article>`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.

        **Details**

        Role selector **does not replace** accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather gives early feedback
        about the ARIA guidelines.

        Many html elements have an implicitly [defined role](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings)
        that is recognized by the role selector. You can find all the
        [supported roles here](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions). ARIA guidelines **do not recommend**
        duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting `role` and/or `aria-*` attributes to default values.

            Required aria role.
        checked : Union[bool, None]

        include_hidden : Union[bool, None]
            Option that controls whether hidden elements are matched. By default, only non-hidden elements, as
            [defined by ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tree_exclusion), are matched by role selector.

            Learn more about [`aria-hidden`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-hidden).
        level : Union[int, None]

        name : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Option to match the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name). By default, matching is
            case-insensitive and searches for a substring, use `exact` to control this behavior.

        # Matches <span>
        page.get_by_text(\"world\")

        # Matches first <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello world\")

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello\", exact=True)

        # Matches both <div>s
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"Hello\"))

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))
        ```

        **Details**

        Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into
        one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.

        Input elements of the type `button` and `submit` are matched by their `value` instead of the text content. For
        example, locating by text `\"Log in\"` matches `<input type=button value=\"Log in\">`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        text : Union[Pattern[str], str]
            Text to locate the element for.
        exact : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a
            regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.

        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can

        to generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
        [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

        `F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
        `Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`,
        etc.

        Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`,
        `ControlOrMeta`. `ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

        Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

        If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective
        texts.

        Shortcuts such as `key: \"Control+o\"`, `key: \"Control++` or `key: \"Control+Shift+T\"` are supported as well. When
        specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.

            Maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The
            default value can be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or
            `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        polling : Union["raf", float, None]
            If `polling` is `'raf'`, then `expression` is constantly executed in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. If `polling`
            is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. Defaults to
            `raf`.

        This method checks or unchecks an element matching `selector` by performing the following steps:
        1. Find an element matching `selector`. If there is none, wait until a matching element is attached to the DOM.
        1. Ensure that matched element is a checkbox or a radio input. If not, this method throws.
        1. If the element already has the right checked state, this method returns immediately.
        1. Wait for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks on the matched element, unless `force` option is set. If
           the element is detached during the checks, the whole action is retried.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.
        1. Use `page.mouse` to click in the center of the element.
        1. Ensure that the element is now checked or unchecked. If not, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to search for an element. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be
            used.
        checked : bool
            Whether to check or uncheck the checkbox.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            This option has no effect.
            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector_or_locator : Union[Locator, str]
            A selector or locator to use when resolving DOM element.
        has_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When
            passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, `"Playwright"` matches
            `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.
        has_not_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element.
            When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.
        has : Union[Locator, None]
            Narrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example,
            `article` that has `text=Playwright` matches `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.

            Inner locator **must be relative** to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not
            the document root. For example, you can find `content` that has `div` in
            `<article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>`. However, looking for `content` that has `article
            div` will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the `content`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        has_not : Union[Locator, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the
            outer one. For example, `article` that does not have `div` matches `<article><span>Playwright</span></article>`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.

        [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure.

        ```html
        <h3>Sign up</h3>
        <label>
          <input type=\"checkbox\" /> Subscribe

        ```py
        expect(page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Sign up\")).to_be_visible()

        page.get_by_role(\"checkbox\", name=\"Subscribe\").check()

        page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=re.compile(\"submit\", re.IGNORECASE)).click()

        **Details**

        Role selector **does not replace** accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather gives early feedback
        about the ARIA guidelines.

        Many html elements have an implicitly [defined role](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings)
        that is recognized by the role selector. You can find all the
        [supported roles here](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions). ARIA guidelines **do not recommend**
        duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting `role` and/or `aria-*` attributes to default values.

        include_hidden : Union[bool, None]
            Option that controls whether hidden elements are matched. By default, only non-hidden elements, as
            [defined by ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tree_exclusion), are matched by role selector.

        level : Union[int, None]
            A number attribute that is usually present for roles `heading`, `listitem`, `row`, `treeitem`, with default values
            for `<h1>-<h6>` elements.

        name : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Option to match the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name). By default, matching is
            case-insensitive and searches for a substring, use `exact` to control this behavior.

        pressed : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-pressed`.

            Learn more about [`aria-selected`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-selected).
        exact : Union[bool, None]
            Whether `name` is matched exactly: case-sensitive and whole-string. Defaults to false. Ignored when `name` is a
            regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.

        Allows locating elements that contain given text.

        See also `locator.filter()` that allows to match by another criteria, like an accessible role, and then

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure:

        ```html
        <div>Hello <span>world</span></div>
        <div>Hello</div>
        ```

        You can locate by text substring, exact string, or a regular expression:

        ```py
        # Matches <span>
        page.get_by_text(\"world\")

        # Matches first <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello world\")

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello\", exact=True)

        # Matches both <div>s
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"Hello\"))

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))
        ```

        **Details**

        Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into
        one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.

        Input elements of the type `button` and `submit` are matched by their `value` instead of the text content. For
        example, locating by text `\"Log in\"` matches `<input type=button value=\"Log in\">`.

        state : Union["attached", "detached", "hidden", "visible", None]

            - `'attached'` - wait for element to be present in DOM.
            - `'detached'` - wait for element to not be present in DOM.

              without any content or with `display:none` has an empty bounding box and is not considered visible.
            - `'hidden'` - wait for element to be either detached from DOM, or have an empty bounding box or
              `visibility:hidden`. This is opposite to the `'visible'` option.

        The snippet below dispatches the `click` event on the element. Regardless of the visibility state of the element,
        `click` is dispatched. This is equivalent to calling
        [element.click()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click).

        **Usage**

        ```py
        page.dispatch_event(\"button#submit\", \"click\")
        ```

        Under the hood, it creates an instance of an event based on the given `type`, initializes it with `eventInit`
        properties and dispatches it on the element. Events are `composed`, `cancelable` and bubble by default.

        Since `eventInit` is event-specific, please refer to the events documentation for the lists of initial properties:
        - [DeviceMotionEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/DeviceMotionEvent)
        - [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent/DeviceOrientationEvent)
        - [DragEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DragEvent/DragEvent)

        - [KeyboardEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/KeyboardEvent)
        - [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/MouseEvent)
        - [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/PointerEvent)

        - [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/WheelEvent)

        You can also specify `JSHandle` as the property value if you want live objects to be passed into the event:

        ```py
        # note you can only create data_transfer in chromium and firefox

        Returns the value of the `expression` invocation.

        If the function passed to the `page.evaluate()` returns a [Promise], then `page.evaluate()` would
        wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.

        If the function passed to the `page.evaluate()` returns a non-[Serializable] value, then
        `page.evaluate()` resolves to `undefined`. Playwright also supports transferring some additional values
        that are not serializable by `JSON`: `-0`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`.

        **Usage**

        Passing argument to `expression`:

        ```py
        result = page.evaluate(\"([x, y]) => Promise.resolve(x * y)\", [7, 8])
        print(result) # prints \"56\"

        A string can also be passed in instead of a function:

        x = 10
        print(page.evaluate(f\"1 + {x}\")) # prints \"11\"
        ```

        `ElementHandle` instances can be passed as an argument to the `page.evaluate()`:

        In the case of multiple pages in a single browser, each page can have its own viewport size. However,

        `page.set_viewport_size()` will resize the page. A lot of websites don't expect phones to change size, so you
        should set the viewport size before navigating to the page. `page.set_viewport_size()` will also reset

        """Page.route

        Routing provides the capability to modify network requests that are made by a page.

        Once routing is enabled, every request matching the url pattern will stall unless it's continued, fulfilled or
        aborted.

        **NOTE** The handler will only be called for the first url if the response is a redirect.

        **NOTE** `page.route()` will not intercept requests intercepted by Service Worker. See
        [this](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1090) issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when
        using request interception by setting `serviceWorkers` to `'block'`.

        **NOTE** `page.route()` will not intercept the first request of a popup page. Use
        `browser_context.route()` instead.

        **Usage**

        An example of a naive handler that aborts all image requests:

        ```py
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.route(\"**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\", lambda route: route.abort())
        page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        browser.close()
        ```

        or the same snippet using a regex pattern instead:

        ```py
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.route(re.compile(r\"(\\.png$)|(\\.jpg$)\"), lambda route: route.abort())
        page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        browser.close()
        ```

        It is possible to examine the request to decide the route action. For example, mocking all requests that contain
        some post data, and leaving all other requests as is:

        ```py
        def handle_route(route: Route):
          if (\"my-string\" in route.request.post_data):
            route.fulfill(body=\"mocked-data\")
          else:
            route.continue_()
        page.route(\"/api/**\", handle_route)
        ```

        Page routes take precedence over browser context routes (set up with `browser_context.route()`) when request
        matches both handlers.

        To remove a route with its handler you can use `page.unroute()`.

        **NOTE** Enabling routing disables http cache.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : Union[Callable[[str], bool], Pattern[str], str]
            A glob pattern, regex pattern, or predicate that receives a [URL] to match during routing. If `baseURL` is set in
            the context options and the provided URL is a string that does not start with `*`, it is resolved using the
            [`new URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) constructor.

        Returns the buffer with the captured screenshot.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        type : Union["jpeg", "png", None]
            Specify screenshot type, defaults to `png`.
        path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            The file path to save the image to. The screenshot type will be inferred from file extension. If `path` is a
            relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. If no path is provided, the image
            won't be saved to the disk.
        quality : Union[int, None]
            The quality of the image, between 0-100. Not applicable to `png` images.
        omit_background : Union[bool, None]
            Hides default white background and allows capturing screenshots with transparency. Not applicable to `jpeg` images.
            Defaults to `false`.
        full_page : Union[bool, None]
            When true, takes a screenshot of the full scrollable page, instead of the currently visible viewport. Defaults to
            `false`.
        clip : Union[{x: float, y: float, width: float, height: float}, None]
            An object which specifies clipping of the resulting image.
        animations : Union["allow", "disabled", None]
            When set to `"disabled"`, stops CSS animations, CSS transitions and Web Animations. Animations get different
            treatment depending on their duration:
            - finite animations are fast-forwarded to completion, so they'll fire `transitionend` event.
            - infinite animations are canceled to initial state, and then played over after the screenshot.

            Defaults to `"allow"` that leaves animations untouched.
        caret : Union["hide", "initial", None]
            When set to `"hide"`, screenshot will hide text caret. When set to `"initial"`, text caret behavior will not be
            changed.  Defaults to `"hide"`.
        scale : Union["css", "device", None]
            When set to `"css"`, screenshot will have a single pixel per each css pixel on the page. For high-dpi devices, this
            will keep screenshots small. Using `"device"` option will produce a single pixel per each device pixel, so
            screenshots of high-dpi devices will be twice as large or even larger.

            Defaults to `"device"`.
        mask : Union[Sequence[Locator], None]
            Specify locators that should be masked when the screenshot is taken. Masked elements will be overlaid with a pink
            box `#FF00FF` (customized by `maskColor`) that completely covers its bounding box. The mask is also applied to
            invisible elements, see [Matching only visible elements](../locators.md#matching-only-visible-elements) to disable
            that.
        mask_color : Union[str, None]
            Specify the color of the overlay box for masked elements, in
            [CSS color format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). Default color is pink `#FF00FF`.
        style : Union[str, None]
            Text of the stylesheet to apply while making the screenshot. This is where you can hide dynamic elements, make
            elements invisible or change their properties to help you creating repeatable screenshots. This stylesheet pierces
            the Shadow DOM and applies to the inner frames.

        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.

        1. Wait for initiated navigations to either succeed or fail, unless `noWaitAfter` option is set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to search for an element. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be
            used.
        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        delay : Union[float, None]
            Time to wait between `mousedown` and `mouseup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
        button : Union["left", "middle", "right", None]
            Defaults to `left`.
        click_count : Union[int, None]
            defaults to 1. See [UIEvent.detail].
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            Actions that initiate navigations are waiting for these navigations to happen and for pages to start loading. You
            can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as
            navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to `false`.
            Deprecated: This option will default to `true` in the future.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard
            `modifiers` will be pressed regardless of `trial` to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys
            are pressed.
        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.

            `modifiers` will be pressed regardless of `trial` to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys
            are pressed.

        """Page.locator

        The method returns an element locator that can be used to perform actions on this page / frame. Locator is resolved
        to the element immediately before performing an action, so a series of actions on the same locator can in fact be
        performed on different DOM elements. That would happen if the DOM structure between those actions has changed.

        [Learn more about locators](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators).

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to use when resolving DOM element.
        has_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When
            passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, `"Playwright"` matches
            `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.
        has_not_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element.
            When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.
        has : Union[Locator, None]
            Narrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example,
            `article` that has `text=Playwright` matches `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.

            Inner locator **must be relative** to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not
            the document root. For example, you can find `content` that has `div` in
            `<article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>`. However, looking for `content` that has `article
            div` will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the `content`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        has_not : Union[Locator, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the
            outer one. For example, `article` that does not have `div` matches `<article><span>Playwright</span></article>`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.

        [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure.

        ```html
        <h3>Sign up</h3>
        <label>
          <input type=\"checkbox\" /> Subscribe

        expect(page.get_by_role(\"heading\", name=\"Sign up\")).to_be_visible()

        page.get_by_role(\"checkbox\", name=\"Subscribe\").check()

        page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=re.compile(\"submit\", re.IGNORECASE)).click()
        ```

        **Details**

        Role selector **does not replace** accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather gives early feedback
        about the ARIA guidelines.

        Many html elements have an implicitly [defined role](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings)
        that is recognized by the role selector. You can find all the
        [supported roles here](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions). ARIA guidelines **do not recommend**
        duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting `role` and/or `aria-*` attributes to default values.

        Parameters
        ----------

            Required aria role.
        checked : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-checked` or native `<input type=checkbox>` controls.

            Learn more about [`aria-checked`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-checked).
        disabled : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-disabled` or `disabled`.

            **NOTE** Unlike most other attributes, `disabled` is inherited through the DOM hierarchy. Learn more about
            [`aria-disabled`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-disabled).

        expanded : Union[bool, None]

            Learn more about [`aria-expanded`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-expanded).
        include_hidden : Union[bool, None]
            Option that controls whether hidden elements are matched. By default, only non-hidden elements, as
            [defined by ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tree_exclusion), are matched by role selector.

            Learn more about [`aria-hidden`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-hidden).
        level : Union[int, None]
            A number attribute that is usually present for roles `heading`, `listitem`, `row`, `treeitem`, with default values
            for `<h1>-<h6>` elements.

            Learn more about [`aria-level`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-level).
        name : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Option to match the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name). By default, matching is
            case-insensitive and searches for a substring, use `exact` to control this behavior.

            Learn more about [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).
        pressed : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-pressed`.

            Learn more about [`aria-pressed`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-pressed).
        selected : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-selected`.

            Learn more about [`aria-selected`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-selected).
        exact : Union[bool, None]
            Whether `name` is matched exactly: case-sensitive and whole-string. Defaults to false. Ignored when `name` is a
            regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.

        You can locate the element by it's test id:

        ```py
        page.get_by_test_id(\"directions\").click()
        ```

        **Details**

        By default, the `data-testid` attribute is used as a test id. Use `selectors.set_test_id_attribute()` to
        configure a different test id attribute if necessary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        test_id : Union[Pattern[str], str]
            Id to locate the element by.

        """Page.get_by_text

        Allows locating elements that contain given text.

        See also `locator.filter()` that allows to match by another criteria, like an accessible role, and then
        filter by the text content.

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure:

        ```html
        <div>Hello <span>world</span></div>
        <div>Hello</div>
        ```

        You can locate by text substring, exact string, or a regular expression:

        ```py
        # Matches <span>
        page.get_by_text(\"world\")

        # Matches first <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello world\")

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(\"Hello\", exact=True)

        # Matches both <div>s
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"Hello\"))

        # Matches second <div>
        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))
        ```

        **Details**

        Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into
        one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.

        Input elements of the type `button` and `submit` are matched by their `value` instead of the text content. For
        example, locating by text `\"Log in\"` matches `<input type=button value=\"Log in\">`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        text : Union[Pattern[str], str]
            Text to locate the element for.
        exact : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to find an exact match: case-sensitive and whole-string. Default to false. Ignored when locating by a
            regular expression. Note that exact match still trims whitespace.

        Returns

            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of

        timeout : Union[float, None]

        until all specified options are present in the `<select>` element and selects these options.

        If the target element is not a `<select>` element, this method throws an error. However, if the element is inside
        the `<label>` element that has an associated
        [control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/control), the control will be used
        instead.

        Returns the array of option values that have been successfully selected.

        Triggers a `change` and `input` event once all the provided options have been selected.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        # Single selection matching the value or label
        page.select_option(\"select#colors\", \"blue\")
        # single selection matching both the label
        page.select_option(\"select#colors\", label=\"blue\")
        # multiple selection
        page.select_option(\"select#colors\", value=[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"])
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector : str
            A selector to search for an element. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be
            used.
        value : Union[Sequence[str], str, None]
            Options to select by value. If the `<select>` has the `multiple` attribute, all given options are selected,
            otherwise only the first option matching one of the passed options is selected. Optional.
        index : Union[Sequence[int], int, None]
            Options to select by index. Optional.
        label : Union[Sequence[str], str, None]
            Options to select by label. If the `<select>` has the `multiple` attribute, all given options are selected,
            otherwise only the first option matching one of the passed options is selected. Optional.
        element : Union[ElementHandle, Sequence[ElementHandle], None]
            Option elements to select. Optional.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            This option has no effect.
            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        strict : Union[bool, None]
            When true, the call requires selector to resolve to a single element. If given selector resolves to more than one
            element, the call throws an exception.

        """Page.press

        Focuses the element, and then uses `keyboard.down()` and `keyboard.up()`.

        `key` can specify the intended
        [keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) value or a single character
        to generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
        [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

        `F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
        `Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`,
        etc.

        Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`,
        `ControlOrMeta`. `ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

        Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

        If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective
        texts.

        Shortcuts such as `key: \"Control+o\"`, `key: \"Control++` or `key: \"Control+Shift+T\"` are supported as well. When
        specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(\"https://keycode.info\")
        page.press(\"body\", \"A\")
        page.screenshot(path=\"a.png\")
        page.press(\"body\", \"ArrowLeft\")

        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can

        Returns when the `expression` returns a truthy value. It resolves to a JSHandle of the truthy value.

        **Usage**

        The `page.wait_for_function()` can be used to observe viewport size change:

        ```py
        from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

        def run(playwright: Playwright):
            webkit = playwright.webkit
            browser = webkit.launch()
            page = browser.new_page()
            page.evaluate(\"window.x = 0; setTimeout(() => { window.x = 100 }, 1000);\")
            page.wait_for_function(\"() => window.x > 0\")
            browser.close()

        with sync_playwright() as playwright:
            run(playwright)
        ```

        To pass an argument to the predicate of `page.wait_for_function()` function:

        ```py
        selector = \".foo\"
        page.wait_for_function(\"selector => !!document.querySelector(selector)\", selector)
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        expression : str
            JavaScript expression to be evaluated in the browser context. If the expression evaluates to a function, the
            function is automatically invoked.
        arg : Union[Any, None]
            Optional argument to pass to `expression`.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The
            default value can be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or
            `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        polling : Union["raf", float, None]
            If `polling` is `'raf'`, then `expression` is constantly executed in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. If `polling`
            is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. Defaults to

        Returns the PDF buffer.

        `page.pdf()` generates a pdf of the page with `print` css media. To generate a pdf with `screen` media, call
        `page.emulate_media()` before calling `page.pdf()`:

        **NOTE** By default, `page.pdf()` generates a pdf with modified colors for printing. Use the
        [`-webkit-print-color-adjust`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-print-color-adjust)
        property to force rendering of exact colors.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        # generates a pdf with \"screen\" media type.
        page.emulate_media(media=\"screen\")
        page.pdf(path=\"page.pdf\")
        ```

        The `width`, `height`, and `margin` options accept values labeled with units. Unlabeled values are treated as
        pixels.

        A few examples:
        - `page.pdf({width: 100})` - prints with width set to 100 pixels
        - `page.pdf({width: '100px'})` - prints with width set to 100 pixels
        - `page.pdf({width: '10cm'})` - prints with width set to 10 centimeters.

        All possible units are:
        - `px` - pixel
        - `in` - inch
        - `cm` - centimeter
        - `mm` - millimeter

        The `format` options are:
        - `Letter`: 8.5in x 11in
        - `Legal`: 8.5in x 14in
        - `Tabloid`: 11in x 17in
        - `Ledger`: 17in x 11in
        - `A0`: 33.1in x 46.8in
        - `A1`: 23.4in x 33.1in
        - `A2`: 16.54in x 23.4in
        - `A3`: 11.7in x 16.54in
        - `A4`: 8.27in x 11.7in
        - `A5`: 5.83in x 8.27in
        - `A6`: 4.13in x 5.83in

        **NOTE** `headerTemplate` and `footerTemplate` markup have the following limitations: > 1. Script tags inside
        templates are not evaluated. > 2. Page styles are not visible inside templates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : Union[float, None]
            Scale of the webpage rendering. Defaults to `1`. Scale amount must be between 0.1 and 2.
        display_header_footer : Union[bool, None]
            Display header and footer. Defaults to `false`.
        header_template : Union[str, None]
            HTML template for the print header. Should be valid HTML markup with following classes used to inject printing
            values into them:
            - `'date'` formatted print date
            - `'title'` document title
            - `'url'` document location
            - `'pageNumber'` current page number
            - `'totalPages'` total pages in the document
        footer_template : Union[str, None]
            HTML template for the print footer. Should use the same format as the `headerTemplate`.
        print_background : Union[bool, None]
            Print background graphics. Defaults to `false`.
        landscape : Union[bool, None]
            Paper orientation. Defaults to `false`.
        page_ranges : Union[str, None]
            Paper ranges to print, e.g., '1-5, 8, 11-13'. Defaults to the empty string, which means print all pages.
        format : Union[str, None]
            Paper format. If set, takes priority over `width` or `height` options. Defaults to 'Letter'.
        width : Union[float, str, None]
            Paper width, accepts values labeled with units.
        height : Union[float, str, None]
            Paper height, accepts values labeled with units.
        prefer_css_page_size : Union[bool, None]
            Give any CSS `@page` size declared in the page priority over what is declared in `width` and `height` or `format`
            options. Defaults to `false`, which will scale the content to fit the paper size.
        margin : Union[{top: Union[float, str, None], right: Union[float, str, None], bottom: Union[float, str, None], left: Union[float, str, None]}, None]
            Paper margins, defaults to none.
        path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            The file path to save the PDF to. If `path` is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working
            directory. If no path is provided, the PDF won't be saved to the disk.
        outline : Union[bool, None]
            Whether or not to embed the document outline into the PDF. Defaults to `false`.
        tagged : Union[bool, None]

        navigation due to History API usage, the navigation will resolve with `null`.

        This resolves when the page navigates to a new URL or reloads. It is useful for when you run code which will

            # This action triggers the navigation after a timeout.
            page.get_by_text(\"Navigate after timeout\").click()
        # Resolves after navigation has finished
        ```

        **NOTE** Usage of the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) to change the URL
        is considered a navigation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : Union[Callable[[str], bool], Pattern[str], str, None]
            A glob pattern, regex pattern or predicate receiving [URL] to match while waiting for the navigation. Note that if
            the parameter is a string without wildcard characters, the method will wait for navigation to URL that is exactly
            equal to the string.
        wait_until : Union["commit", "domcontentloaded", "load", "networkidle", None]
            When to consider operation succeeded, defaults to `load`. Events can be either:
            - `'domcontentloaded'` - consider operation to be finished when the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired.
            - `'load'` - consider operation to be finished when the `load` event is fired.
            - `'networkidle'` - **DISCOURAGED** consider operation to be finished when there are no network connections for
              at least `500` ms. Don't use this method for testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead.
            - `'commit'` - consider operation to be finished when network response is received and the document started
              loading.

        """Page.add_locator_handler

        When testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays like a \"Sign up\" dialog appear and block actions you want to
        automate, e.g. clicking a button. These overlays don't always show up in the same way or at the same time, making
        them tricky to handle in automated tests.

        This method lets you set up a special function, called a handler, that activates when it detects that overlay is
        visible. The handler's job is to remove the overlay, allowing your test to continue as if the overlay wasn't there.

        Things to keep in mind:
        - When an overlay is shown predictably, we recommend explicitly waiting for it in your test and dismissing it as
          a part of your normal test flow, instead of using `page.add_locator_handler()`.
        - Playwright checks for the overlay every time before executing or retrying an action that requires an
          [actionability check](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability), or before performing an auto-waiting assertion check. When overlay
          is visible, Playwright calls the handler first, and then proceeds with the action/assertion. Note that the
          handler is only called when you perform an action/assertion - if the overlay becomes visible but you don't
          perform any actions, the handler will not be triggered.
        - After executing the handler, Playwright will ensure that overlay that triggered the handler is not visible
          anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with `noWaitAfter`.
        - The execution time of the handler counts towards the timeout of the action/assertion that executed the handler.
          If your handler takes too long, it might cause timeouts.
        - You can register multiple handlers. However, only a single handler will be running at a time. Make sure the
          actions within a handler don't depend on another handler.

        **NOTE** Running the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently focused
        element and move the mouse. Make sure that actions that run after the handler are self-contained and do not rely on
        the focus and mouse state being unchanged.

        For example, consider a test that calls `locator.focus()` followed by `keyboard.press()`. If your
        handler clicks a button between these two actions, the focused element most likely will be wrong, and key press
        will happen on the unexpected element. Use `locator.press()` instead to avoid this problem.

        Another example is a series of mouse actions, where `mouse.move()` is followed by `mouse.down()`.
        Again, when the handler runs between these two actions, the mouse position will be wrong during the mouse down.
        Prefer self-contained actions like `locator.click()` that do not rely on the state being unchanged by a
        handler.

        **Usage**

        An example that closes a \"Sign up to the newsletter\" dialog when it appears:

        ```py
        # Setup the handler.
        async def handler():
          await page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"No thanks\").click()
        await page.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_text(\"Sign up to the newsletter\"), handler)

        # Write the test as usual.
        await page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        await page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()
        ```

        An example that skips the \"Confirm your security details\" page when it is shown:

        ```py
        # Setup the handler.
        async def handler():
          await page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Remind me later\").click()
        await page.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_text(\"Confirm your security details\"), handler)

        # Write the test as usual.
        await page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        await page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()
        ```

        An example with a custom callback on every actionability check. It uses a `<body>` locator that is always visible,
        so the handler is called before every actionability check. It is important to specify `noWaitAfter`, because the
        handler does not hide the `<body>` element.

        ```py
        # Setup the handler.
        async def handler():
          await page.evaluate(\"window.removeObstructionsForTestIfNeeded()\")
        await page.add_locator_handler(page.locator(\"body\"), handler, no_wait_after=True)

        # Write the test as usual.
        await page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        await page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Start here\").click()
        ```

        Handler takes the original locator as an argument. You can also automatically remove the handler after a number of
        invocations by setting `times`:

        ```py
        async def handler(locator):
          await locator.click()
        await page.add_locator_handler(page.get_by_label(\"Close\"), handler, times=1)
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        locator : Locator
            Locator that triggers the handler.
        handler : Union[Callable[[Locator], Any], Callable[[], Any]]
            Function that should be run once `locator` appears. This function should get rid of the element that blocks actions
            like click.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            By default, after calling the handler Playwright will wait until the overlay becomes hidden, and only then
            Playwright will continue with the action/assertion that triggered the handler. This option allows to opt-out of
            this behavior, so that overlay can stay visible after the handler has run.
        times : Union[int, None]
            Specifies the maximum number of times this handler should be called. Unlimited by default.

        """BrowserContext.route

        Routing provides the capability to modify network requests that are made by any page in the browser context. Once
        route is enabled, every request matching the url pattern will stall unless it's continued, fulfilled or aborted.

        **NOTE** `browser_context.route()` will not intercept requests intercepted by Service Worker. See
        [this](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1090) issue. We recommend disabling Service Workers when
        using request interception by setting `serviceWorkers` to `'block'`.

        **Usage**

        An example of a naive handler that aborts all image requests:

        ```py
        context = browser.new_context()
        page = context.new_page()
        context.route(\"**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\", lambda route: route.abort())
        page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        browser.close()
        ```

        or the same snippet using a regex pattern instead:

        ```py
        context = browser.new_context()
        page = context.new_page()
        context.route(re.compile(r\"(\\.png$)|(\\.jpg$)\"), lambda route: route.abort())
        page = await context.new_page()
        page = context.new_page()
        page.goto(\"https://example.com\")
        browser.close()
        ```

        It is possible to examine the request to decide the route action. For example, mocking all requests that contain
        some post data, and leaving all other requests as is:

        ```py
        def handle_route(route: Route):
          if (\"my-string\" in route.request.post_data):
            route.fulfill(body=\"mocked-data\")
          else:
            route.continue_()
        context.route(\"/api/**\", handle_route)
        ```

        Page routes (set up with `page.route()`) take precedence over browser context routes when request matches
        both handlers.

        To remove a route with its handler you can use `browser_context.unroute()`.

        **NOTE** Enabling routing disables http cache.

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : Union[Callable[[str], bool], Pattern[str], str]
            A glob pattern, regex pattern, or predicate that receives a [URL] to match during routing. If `baseURL` is set in

            viewport. Learn more about [viewport emulation](../emulation.md#viewport).
        screen : Union[{width: int, height: int}, None]
            Emulates consistent window screen size available inside web page via `window.screen`. Is only used when the
            `viewport` is set.
        no_viewport : Union[bool, None]
            Does not enforce fixed viewport, allows resizing window in the headed mode.
        ignore_https_errors : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when sending network requests. Defaults to `false`.
        java_script_enabled : Union[bool, None]
            Whether or not to enable JavaScript in the context. Defaults to `true`. Learn more about
            [disabling JavaScript](../emulation.md#javascript-enabled).
        bypass_csp : Union[bool, None]
            Toggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy. Defaults to `false`.
        user_agent : Union[str, None]
            Specific user agent to use in this context.
        locale : Union[str, None]
            Specify user locale, for example `en-GB`, `de-DE`, etc. Locale will affect `navigator.language` value,
            `Accept-Language` request header value as well as number and date formatting rules. Defaults to the system default
            locale. Learn more about emulation in our [emulation guide](../emulation.md#locale--timezone).
        timezone_id : Union[str, None]
            Changes the timezone of the context. See
            [ICU's metaZones.txt](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/icu/source/data/misc/metaZones.txt?rcl=faee8bc70570192d82d2978a71e2a615788597d1)
            for a list of supported timezone IDs. Defaults to the system timezone.
        geolocation : Union[{latitude: float, longitude: float, accuracy: Union[float, None]}, None]
        permissions : Union[Sequence[str], None]
            A list of permissions to grant to all pages in this context. See `browser_context.grant_permissions()` for
            more details. Defaults to none.
        extra_http_headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            An object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request. Defaults to none.
        offline : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to emulate network being offline. Defaults to `false`. Learn more about
            [network emulation](../emulation.md#offline).
        http_credentials : Union[{username: str, password: str, origin: Union[str, None], send: Union["always", "unauthorized", None]}, None]
            Credentials for [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). If no
            origin is specified, the username and password are sent to any servers upon unauthorized responses.
        device_scale_factor : Union[float, None]
            Specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr). Defaults to `1`. Learn more about
            [emulating devices with device scale factor](../emulation.md#devices).
        is_mobile : Union[bool, None]
            Whether the `meta viewport` tag is taken into account and touch events are enabled. isMobile is a part of device,
            so you don't actually need to set it manually. Defaults to `false` and is not supported in Firefox. Learn more
            about [mobile emulation](../emulation.md#ismobile).
        has_touch : Union[bool, None]

            media feature, supported values are `'light'` and `'dark'`. See `page.emulate_media()` for more details.
            Passing `'null'` resets emulation to system defaults. Defaults to `'light'`.
        reduced_motion : Union["no-preference", "null", "reduce", None]
            Emulates `'prefers-reduced-motion'` media feature, supported values are `'reduce'`, `'no-preference'`. See
            `page.emulate_media()` for more details. Passing `'null'` resets emulation to system defaults. Defaults to
            `'no-preference'`.
        forced_colors : Union["active", "none", "null", None]
            Emulates `'forced-colors'` media feature, supported values are `'active'`, `'none'`. See
            `page.emulate_media()` for more details. Passing `'null'` resets emulation to system defaults. Defaults to
            `'none'`.
        contrast : Union["more", "no-preference", "null", None]

            cookies, security and other types of HAR information that are not used when replaying from HAR. Defaults to `full`.
        record_har_content : Union["attach", "embed", "omit", None]
            Optional setting to control resource content management. If `omit` is specified, content is not persisted. If
            `attach` is specified, resources are persisted as separate files and all of these files are archived along with the
            HAR file. Defaults to `embed`, which stores content inline the HAR file as per HAR specification.

            TLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.

            **Details**

            An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both `certPath` and `keyPath`,
            a single `pfxPath`, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (`cert` and `key`, or `pfx`). Optionally,
            `passphrase` property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The `origin` property should be provided
            with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.

            Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to
            reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an `origin` that
            does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.

            **NOTE** When using WebKit on macOS, accessing `localhost` will not pick up client certificates. You can make it
            work by replacing `localhost` with `local.playwright`.

        """Browser.new_page

        Creates a new page in a new browser context. Closing this page will close the context as well.

        This is a convenience API that should only be used for the single-page scenarios and short snippets. Production
        code and testing frameworks should explicitly create `browser.new_context()` followed by the
        `browser_context.new_page()` to control their exact life times.

            An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both `certPath` and `keyPath`,
            a single `pfxPath`, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (`cert` and `key`, or `pfx`). Optionally,
            `passphrase` property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The `origin` property should be provided
            with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.

            Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to
            reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an `origin` that
            does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.

            **NOTE** When using WebKit on macOS, accessing `localhost` will not pick up client certificates. You can make it
            work by replacing `localhost` with `local.playwright`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        executable_path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            Path to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If `executablePath` is a relative path, then it is
            resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium,
            Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.
        channel : Union[str, None]
            Browser distribution channel.

            Use "chromium" to [opt in to new headless mode](../browsers.md#chromium-new-headless-mode).

            Use "chrome", "chrome-beta", "chrome-dev", "chrome-canary", "msedge", "msedge-beta", "msedge-dev", or
            "msedge-canary" to use branded [Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge](../browsers.md#google-chrome--microsoft-edge).
        args : Union[Sequence[str], None]
            **NOTE** Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.

            Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found
            [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).
        ignore_default_args : Union[Sequence[str], bool, None]
            If `true`, Playwright does not pass its own configurations args and only uses the ones from `args`. If an array is
            given, then filters out the given default arguments. Dangerous option; use with care. Defaults to `false`.
        handle_sigint : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on Ctrl-C. Defaults to `true`.
        handle_sigterm : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on SIGTERM. Defaults to `true`.
        handle_sighup : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on SIGHUP. Defaults to `true`.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0`
            to disable timeout.
        env : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], None]
            Specify environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Defaults to `process.env`.
        headless : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to run browser in headless mode. More details for
            [Chromium](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) and
            [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/12/using-headless-mode-in-firefox/). Defaults to `true` unless the
            `devtools` option is `true`.
        devtools : Union[bool, None]
            **Chromium-only** Whether to auto-open a Developer Tools panel for each tab. If this option is `true`, the
            `headless` option will be set `false`.
            Deprecated: Use [debugging tools](../debug.md) instead.
        proxy : Union[{server: str, bypass: Union[str, None], username: Union[str, None], password: Union[str, None]}, None]
            Network proxy settings.
        downloads_path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            If specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and
            is deleted when browser is closed. In either case, the downloads are deleted when the browser context they were
            created in is closed.
        slow_mo : Union[float, None]
            Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going
            on.
        traces_dir : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            If specified, traces are saved into this directory.
        chromium_sandbox : Union[bool, None]
            Enable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to `false`.
        firefox_user_prefs : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], None]
            Firefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at
            [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox).

            You can also provide a path to a custom [`policies.json` file](https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates/) via
            `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON` environment variable.

        user_data_dir : Union[pathlib.Path, str]
            Path to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. Pass an empty
            string to create a temporary directory.

            More details for
            [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/user_data_dir.md#introduction) and
            [Firefox](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/CommandLineOptions#User_profile). Chromium's user data directory is the
            **parent** directory of the "Profile Path" seen at `chrome://version`.

            Note that browsers do not allow launching multiple instances with the same User Data Directory.

            **NOTE** Chromium/Chrome: Due to recent Chrome policy changes, automating the default Chrome user profile is not
            supported. Pointing `userDataDir` to Chrome's main "User Data" directory (the profile used for your regular
            browsing) may result in pages not loading or the browser exiting. Create and use a separate directory (for example,
            an empty folder) as your automation profile instead. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port
            for details.

        channel : Union[str, None]
            Browser distribution channel.

            Use "chromium" to [opt in to new headless mode](../browsers.md#chromium-new-headless-mode).

            Use "chrome", "chrome-beta", "chrome-dev", "chrome-canary", "msedge", "msedge-beta", "msedge-dev", or
            "msedge-canary" to use branded [Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge](../browsers.md#google-chrome--microsoft-edge).
        executable_path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            Path to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If `executablePath` is a relative path, then it is
            resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium,
            Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.
        args : Union[Sequence[str], None]
            **NOTE** Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.

            Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found
            [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).
        ignore_default_args : Union[Sequence[str], bool, None]
            If `true`, Playwright does not pass its own configurations args and only uses the ones from `args`. If an array is
            given, then filters out the given default arguments. Dangerous option; use with care. Defaults to `false`.
        handle_sigint : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on Ctrl-C. Defaults to `true`.
        handle_sigterm : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on SIGTERM. Defaults to `true`.
        handle_sighup : Union[bool, None]
            Close the browser process on SIGHUP. Defaults to `true`.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0`
            to disable timeout.
        env : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], None]
            Specify environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Defaults to `process.env`.
        headless : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to run browser in headless mode. More details for
            [Chromium](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) and
            [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/12/using-headless-mode-in-firefox/). Defaults to `true` unless the
            `devtools` option is `true`.
        devtools : Union[bool, None]
            **Chromium-only** Whether to auto-open a Developer Tools panel for each tab. If this option is `true`, the
            `headless` option will be set `false`.
            Deprecated: Use [debugging tools](../debug.md) instead.
        proxy : Union[{server: str, bypass: Union[str, None], username: Union[str, None], password: Union[str, None]}, None]
            Network proxy settings.
        downloads_path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            If specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and
            is deleted when browser is closed. In either case, the downloads are deleted when the browser context they were
            created in is closed.
        slow_mo : Union[float, None]
            Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going
            on.
        viewport : Union[{width: int, height: int}, None]
            Sets a consistent viewport for each page. Defaults to an 1280x720 viewport. `no_viewport` disables the fixed
            viewport. Learn more about [viewport emulation](../emulation.md#viewport).
        screen : Union[{width: int, height: int}, None]
            Emulates consistent window screen size available inside web page via `window.screen`. Is only used when the
            `viewport` is set.
        no_viewport : Union[bool, None]
            Does not enforce fixed viewport, allows resizing window in the headed mode.
        ignore_https_errors : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when sending network requests. Defaults to `false`.
        java_script_enabled : Union[bool, None]
            Whether or not to enable JavaScript in the context. Defaults to `true`. Learn more about
            [disabling JavaScript](../emulation.md#javascript-enabled).
        bypass_csp : Union[bool, None]
            Toggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy. Defaults to `false`.
        user_agent : Union[str, None]
            Specific user agent to use in this context.
        locale : Union[str, None]
            Specify user locale, for example `en-GB`, `de-DE`, etc. Locale will affect `navigator.language` value,
            `Accept-Language` request header value as well as number and date formatting rules. Defaults to the system default
            locale. Learn more about emulation in our [emulation guide](../emulation.md#locale--timezone).
        timezone_id : Union[str, None]
            Changes the timezone of the context. See
            [ICU's metaZones.txt](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/icu/source/data/misc/metaZones.txt?rcl=faee8bc70570192d82d2978a71e2a615788597d1)

        geolocation : Union[{latitude: float, longitude: float, accuracy: Union[float, None]}, None]
        permissions : Union[Sequence[str], None]
            A list of permissions to grant to all pages in this context. See `browser_context.grant_permissions()` for
            more details. Defaults to none.
        extra_http_headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            An object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request. Defaults to none.
        offline : Union[bool, None]

            Credentials for [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). If no
            origin is specified, the username and password are sent to any servers upon unauthorized responses.
        device_scale_factor : Union[float, None]
            Specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr). Defaults to `1`. Learn more about
            [emulating devices with device scale factor](../emulation.md#devices).
        is_mobile : Union[bool, None]
            Whether the `meta viewport` tag is taken into account and touch events are enabled. isMobile is a part of device,
            so you don't actually need to set it manually. Defaults to `false` and is not supported in Firefox. Learn more
            about [mobile emulation](../emulation.md#ismobile).
        has_touch : Union[bool, None]
            Specifies if viewport supports touch events. Defaults to false. Learn more about

        forced_colors : Union["active", "none", "null", None]
            Emulates `'forced-colors'` media feature, supported values are `'active'`, `'none'`. See
            `page.emulate_media()` for more details. Passing `'null'` resets emulation to system defaults. Defaults to
            `'none'`.
        contrast : Union["more", "no-preference", "null", None]
            Emulates `'prefers-contrast'` media feature, supported values are `'no-preference'`, `'more'`. See
            `page.emulate_media()` for more details. Passing `'null'` resets emulation to system defaults. Defaults to

            If specified, traces are saved into this directory.
        chromium_sandbox : Union[bool, None]
            Enable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to `false`.
        firefox_user_prefs : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], None]
            Firefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at
            [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox).

            You can also provide a path to a custom [`policies.json` file](https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates/) via
            `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON` environment variable.
        record_har_path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            Enables [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec) recording for all pages into the specified HAR file
            on the filesystem. If not specified, the HAR is not recorded. Make sure to call `browser_context.close()`
            for the HAR to be saved.
        record_har_omit_content : Union[bool, None]
            Optional setting to control whether to omit request content from the HAR. Defaults to `false`.
        record_video_dir : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            Enables video recording for all pages into the specified directory. If not specified videos are not recorded. Make
            sure to call `browser_context.close()` for videos to be saved.
        record_video_size : Union[{width: int, height: int}, None]
            Dimensions of the recorded videos. If not specified the size will be equal to `viewport` scaled down to fit into
            800x800. If `viewport` is not configured explicitly the video size defaults to 800x450. Actual picture of each page
            will be scaled down if necessary to fit the specified size.
        base_url : Union[str, None]
            When using `page.goto()`, `page.route()`, `page.wait_for_url()`,
            `page.expect_request()`, or `page.expect_response()` it takes the base URL in consideration by
            using the [`URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) constructor for building the
            corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples:
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000` and navigating to `/bar.html` results in `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo/` and navigating to `./bar.html` results in
              `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html`
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo` (without trailing slash) and navigating to `./bar.html` results in
              `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`
        strict_selectors : Union[bool, None]
            If set to true, enables strict selectors mode for this context. In the strict selectors mode all operations on
            selectors that imply single target DOM element will throw when more than one element matches the selector. This
            option does not affect any Locator APIs (Locators are always strict). Defaults to `false`. See `Locator` to learn
            more about the strict mode.
        service_workers : Union["allow", "block", None]
            Whether to allow sites to register Service workers. Defaults to `'allow'`.
            - `'allow'`: [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) can be
              registered.
            - `'block'`: Playwright will block all registration of Service Workers.
        record_har_url_filter : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
        record_har_mode : Union["full", "minimal", None]
            When set to `minimal`, only record information necessary for routing from HAR. This omits sizes, timing, page,
            cookies, security and other types of HAR information that are not used when replaying from HAR. Defaults to `full`.
        record_har_content : Union["attach", "embed", "omit", None]
            Optional setting to control resource content management. If `omit` is specified, content is not persisted. If
            `attach` is specified, resources are persisted as separate files and all of these files are archived along with the
            HAR file. Defaults to `embed`, which stores content inline the HAR file as per HAR specification.
        client_certificates : Union[Sequence[{origin: str, certPath: Union[pathlib.Path, str, None], cert: Union[bytes, None], keyPath: Union[pathlib.Path, str, None], key: Union[bytes, None], pfxPath: Union[pathlib.Path, str, None], pfx: Union[bytes, None], passphrase: Union[str, None]}], None]
            TLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.

            **Details**

            An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both `certPath` and `keyPath`,
            a single `pfxPath`, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (`cert` and `key`, or `pfx`). Optionally,
            `passphrase` property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The `origin` property should be provided
            with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.

            Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to
            reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an `origin` that
            does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.

            **NOTE** When using WebKit on macOS, accessing `localhost` will not pick up client certificates. You can make it
            work by replacing `localhost` with `local.playwright`.

        This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

        The default browser context is accessible via `browser.contexts()`.

        **NOTE** Connecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.

        **NOTE** This connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via
        `browser_type.connect()`. If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you
        probably want to use `browser_type.connect()`.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(\"http://localhost:9222\")
        default_context = browser.contexts[0]
        page = default_context.pages[0]
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        endpoint_url : str
            A CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example `http://localhost:9222/` or
            `ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4`.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass
            `0` to disable timeout.
        slow_mo : Union[float, None]
            Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going
            on. Defaults to 0.
        headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]

        This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via `BrowserType.launchServer` in Node.js.

        **NOTE** The major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of
        Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 → is compatible with 1.2.x).

        Parameters
        ----------
        ws_endpoint : str
            A Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via `BrowserServer.wsEndpoint`.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to `0` (no timeout).
        slow_mo : Union[float, None]
            Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going
            on. Defaults to 0.
        headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            Additional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.
        expose_network : Union[str, None]
            This option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a
            list of rules separated by comma.

            Available rules:
            1. Hostname pattern, for example: `example.com`, `*.org:99`, `x.*.y.com`, `*foo.org`.
            1. IP literal, for example: `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0:99`, `[::1]`, `[0:0::1]:99`.
            1. `<loopback>` that matches local loopback interfaces: `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`.

            Some common examples:
            1. `"*"` to expose all network.
            1. `"<loopback>"` to expose localhost network.
            1. `"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>"` to expose test/staging deployments and
               localhost.

        This method returns the bounding box of the element matching the locator, or `null` if the element is not visible.
        The bounding box is calculated relative to the main frame viewport - which is usually the same as the browser
        window.

        **Details**

        Scrolling affects the returned bounding box, similarly to
        [Element.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).
        That means `x` and/or `y` may be negative.

        Elements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the
        [Element.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect).

        Assuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input. For example, the
        following snippet should click the center of the element.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        box = page.get_by_role(\"button\").bounding_box()
        page.mouse.click(box[\"x\"] + box[\"width\"] / 2, box[\"y\"] + box[\"height\"] / 2)

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.

        **Details**

        Performs the following steps:
        1. Ensure that element is a checkbox or a radio input. If not, this method throws. If the element is already
           checked, this method returns immediately.
        1. Wait for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks on the element, unless `force` option is set.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.
        1. Use `page.mouse` to click in the center of the element.
        1. Ensure that the element is now checked. If not, this method throws.

        If the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        **Usage**

        ```py

        Parameters
        ----------

        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can

        force : Union[bool, None]

            This option has no effect.
            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.

        """Locator.click

        Click an element.

        **Details**

        This method clicks the element by performing the following steps:
        1. Wait for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks on the element, unless `force` option is set.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.
        1. Use `page.mouse` to click in the center of the element, or the specified `position`.
        1. Wait for initiated navigations to either succeed or fail, unless `noWaitAfter` option is set.

        If the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        **Usage**

        Click a button:

        ```py
        page.get_by_role(\"button\").click()
        ```

        Shift-right-click at a specific position on a canvas:

        ```py
        page.locator(\"canvas\").click(
            button=\"right\", modifiers=[\"Shift\"], position={\"x\": 23, \"y\": 32}
        )
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        delay : Union[float, None]
            Time to wait between `mousedown` and `mouseup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
        button : Union["left", "middle", "right", None]
            Defaults to `left`.
        click_count : Union[int, None]
            defaults to 1. See [UIEvent.detail].
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            Actions that initiate navigations are waiting for these navigations to happen and for pages to start loading. You
            can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as
            navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to `false`.
            Deprecated: This option will default to `true` in the future.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard
            `modifiers` will be pressed regardless of `trial` to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys
            are pressed.

        Programmatically dispatch an event on the matching element.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        locator.dispatch_event(\"click\")
        ```

        **Details**

        The snippet above dispatches the `click` event on the element. Regardless of the visibility state of the element,
        `click` is dispatched. This is equivalent to calling
        [element.click()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click).

        Under the hood, it creates an instance of an event based on the given `type`, initializes it with `eventInit`
        properties and dispatches it on the element. Events are `composed`, `cancelable` and bubble by default.

        Since `eventInit` is event-specific, please refer to the events documentation for the lists of initial properties:
        - [DeviceMotionEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/DeviceMotionEvent)
        - [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent/DeviceOrientationEvent)
        - [DragEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DragEvent/DragEvent)
        - [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Event)
        - [FocusEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FocusEvent/FocusEvent)
        - [KeyboardEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/KeyboardEvent)
        - [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/MouseEvent)
        - [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/PointerEvent)
        - [TouchEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/TouchEvent)
        - [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/WheelEvent)

        You can also specify `JSHandle` as the property value if you want live objects to be passed into the event:

        ```py
        data_transfer = page.evaluate_handle(\"new DataTransfer()\")
        locator.dispatch_event(\"#source\", \"dragstart\", {\"dataTransfer\": data_transfer})
        ```

            Optional event-specific initialization properties.
        timeout : Union[float, None]

        The method finds an element matching the specified selector in the locator's subtree. It also accepts filter
        options, similar to `locator.filter()` method.

        [Learn more about locators](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators).

        Parameters
        ----------
        selector_or_locator : Union[Locator, str]
            A selector or locator to use when resolving DOM element.
        has_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When
            passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, `"Playwright"` matches
            `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.
        has_not_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element.
            When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.
        has : Union[Locator, None]
            Narrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example,
            `article` that has `text=Playwright` matches `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.

            Inner locator **must be relative** to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not
            the document root. For example, you can find `content` that has `div` in
            `<article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>`. However, looking for `content` that has `article
            div` will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the `content`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        has_not : Union[Locator, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the
            outer one. For example, `article` that does not have `div` matches `<article><span>Playwright</span></article>`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.

        [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure.

        **Details**

        Role selector **does not replace** accessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather gives early feedback
        about the ARIA guidelines.

        Many html elements have an implicitly [defined role](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings)
        that is recognized by the role selector. You can find all the
        [supported roles here](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions). ARIA guidelines **do not recommend**
        duplicating implicit roles and attributes by setting `role` and/or `aria-*` attributes to default values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        role : Union["alert", "alertdialog", "application", "article", "banner", "blockquote", "button", "caption", "cell", "checkbox", "code", "columnheader", "combobox", "complementary", "contentinfo", "definition", "deletion", "dialog", "directory", "document", "emphasis", "feed", "figure", "form", "generic", "grid", "gridcell", "group", "heading", "img", "insertion", "link", "list", "listbox", "listitem", "log", "main", "marquee", "math", "menu", "menubar", "menuitem", "menuitemcheckbox", "menuitemradio", "meter", "navigation", "none", "note", "option", "paragraph", "presentation", "progressbar", "radio", "radiogroup", "region", "row", "rowgroup", "rowheader", "scrollbar", "search", "searchbox", "separator", "slider", "spinbutton", "status", "strong", "subscript", "superscript", "switch", "tab", "table", "tablist", "tabpanel", "term", "textbox", "time", "timer", "toolbar", "tooltip", "tree", "treegrid", "treeitem"]
            Required aria role.
        checked : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-checked` or native `<input type=checkbox>` controls.

            Learn more about [`aria-checked`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-checked).
        disabled : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-disabled` or `disabled`.

            **NOTE** Unlike most other attributes, `disabled` is inherited through the DOM hierarchy. Learn more about
            [`aria-disabled`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-disabled).

        include_hidden : Union[bool, None]
            Option that controls whether hidden elements are matched. By default, only non-hidden elements, as
            [defined by ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#tree_exclusion), are matched by role selector.

            Learn more about [`aria-hidden`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-hidden).
        level : Union[int, None]
            A number attribute that is usually present for roles `heading`, `listitem`, `row`, `treeitem`, with default values
            for `<h1>-<h6>` elements.

        name : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Option to match the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name). By default, matching is
            case-insensitive and searches for a substring, use `exact` to control this behavior.

            Learn more about [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).
        pressed : Union[bool, None]
            An attribute that is usually set by `aria-pressed`.

        **Usage**

        Consider the following DOM structure:

        <div>Hello <span>world</span></div>
        <div>Hello</div>

        # Matches first <div>

        page.get_by_text(re.compile(\"^hello$\", re.IGNORECASE))
        ```

        **Details**

        Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into
        one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.

        Input elements of the type `button` and `submit` are matched by their `value` instead of the text content. For
        example, locating by text `\"Log in\"` matches `<input type=button value=\"Log in\">`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        has_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements containing specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. When
            passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring. For example, `"Playwright"` matches
            `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.
        has_not_text : Union[Pattern[str], str, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain specified text somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element.
            When passed a [string], matching is case-insensitive and searches for a substring.
        has : Union[Locator, None]
            Narrows down the results of the method to those which contain elements matching this relative locator. For example,
            `article` that has `text=Playwright` matches `<article><div>Playwright</div></article>`.

            Inner locator **must be relative** to the outer locator and is queried starting with the outer locator match, not
            the document root. For example, you can find `content` that has `div` in
            `<article><content><div>Playwright</div></content></article>`. However, looking for `content` that has `article
            div` will fail, because the inner locator must be relative and should not use any elements outside the `content`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        has_not : Union[Locator, None]
            Matches elements that do not contain an element that matches an inner locator. Inner locator is queried against the
            outer one. For example, `article` that does not have `div` matches `<article><span>Playwright</span></article>`.

            Note that outer and inner locators must belong to the same frame. Inner locator must not contain `FrameLocator`s.
        visible : Union[bool, None]
            Only matches visible or invisible elements.

        Creates a locator matching all elements that match one or both of the two locators.

        Note that when both locators match something, the resulting locator will have multiple matches, potentially causing

        **Usage**

        Consider a scenario where you'd like to click on a \"New email\" button, but sometimes a security settings dialog
        shows up instead. In this case, you can wait for either a \"New email\" button, or a dialog and act accordingly.

        **NOTE** If both \"New email\" button and security dialog appear on screen, the \"or\" locator will match both of them,
        possibly throwing the [\"strict mode violation\" error](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators#strictness). In this case, you can use
        `locator.first()` to only match one of them.

        If the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        Parameters
        ----------
        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of

        ```

        **Details**

        Focuses the element, and then uses `keyboard.down()` and `keyboard.up()`.

        `key` can specify the intended
        [keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) value or a single character
        to generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
        [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

        `F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
        `Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`,
        etc.

        Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`,
        `ControlOrMeta`. `ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

        Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

        If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective
        texts.

        Shortcuts such as `key: \"Control+o\"`, `key: \"Control++` or `key: \"Control+Shift+T\"` are supported as well. When
        specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str
            Name of the key to press or a character to generate, such as `ArrowLeft` or `a`.
        delay : Union[float, None]
            Time to wait between `keydown` and `keyup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            Actions that initiate navigations are waiting for these navigations to happen and for pages to start loading. You
            can opt out of waiting via setting this flag. You would only need this option in the exceptional cases such as
            navigating to inaccessible pages. Defaults to `false`.

        page.get_by_role(\"link\").screenshot(animations=\"disabled\", path=\"link.png\")
        ```

        **Details**

        This method captures a screenshot of the page, clipped to the size and position of a particular element matching
        the locator. If the element is covered by other elements, it will not be actually visible on the screenshot. If the
        element is a scrollable container, only the currently scrolled content will be visible on the screenshot.

        This method waits for the [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks, then scrolls element into view before taking
        a screenshot. If the element is detached from DOM, the method throws an error.

        Returns the buffer with the captured screenshot.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        type : Union["jpeg", "png", None]
            Specify screenshot type, defaults to `png`.
        path : Union[pathlib.Path, str, None]
            The file path to save the image to. The screenshot type will be inferred from file extension. If `path` is a
            relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. If no path is provided, the image
            won't be saved to the disk.
        quality : Union[int, None]
            The quality of the image, between 0-100. Not applicable to `png` images.
        omit_background : Union[bool, None]
            Hides default white background and allows capturing screenshots with transparency. Not applicable to `jpeg` images.
            Defaults to `false`.
        animations : Union["allow", "disabled", None]
            When set to `"disabled"`, stops CSS animations, CSS transitions and Web Animations. Animations get different
            treatment depending on their duration:
            - finite animations are fast-forwarded to completion, so they'll fire `transitionend` event.
            - infinite animations are canceled to initial state, and then played over after the screenshot.

            Defaults to `"allow"` that leaves animations untouched.
        caret : Union["hide", "initial", None]
            When set to `"hide"`, screenshot will hide text caret. When set to `"initial"`, text caret behavior will not be
            changed.  Defaults to `"hide"`.
        scale : Union["css", "device", None]
            When set to `"css"`, screenshot will have a single pixel per each css pixel on the page. For high-dpi devices, this
            will keep screenshots small. Using `"device"` option will produce a single pixel per each device pixel, so
            screenshots of high-dpi devices will be twice as large or even larger.

            Defaults to `"device"`.
        mask : Union[Sequence[Locator], None]
            Specify locators that should be masked when the screenshot is taken. Masked elements will be overlaid with a pink
            box `#FF00FF` (customized by `maskColor`) that completely covers its bounding box. The mask is also applied to
            invisible elements, see [Matching only visible elements](../locators.md#matching-only-visible-elements) to disable
            that.
        mask_color : Union[str, None]
            Specify the color of the overlay box for masked elements, in
            [CSS color format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). Default color is pink `#FF00FF`.
        style : Union[str, None]
            Text of the stylesheet to apply while making the screenshot. This is where you can hide dynamic elements, make
            elements invisible or change their properties to help you creating repeatable screenshots. This stylesheet pierces
            the Shadow DOM and applies to the inner frames.

        **Details**

        This method captures the aria snapshot of the given element. The snapshot is a string that represents the state of
        the element and its children. The snapshot can be used to assert the state of the element in the test, or to
        compare it to state in the future.

        The ARIA snapshot is represented using [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) markup language:
        - The keys of the objects are the roles and optional accessible names of the elements.
        - The values are either text content or an array of child elements.
        - Generic static text can be represented with the `text` key.

        Below is the HTML markup and the respective ARIA snapshot:

        ```html
        <ul aria-label=\"Links\">
          <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>

        Selects option or options in `<select>`.

        **Details**

        This method waits for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks, waits until all specified options are present in
        the `<select>` element and selects these options.

        If the target element is not a `<select>` element, this method throws an error. However, if the element is inside
        the `<label>` element that has an associated
        [control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/control), the control will be used
        instead.

        Returns the array of option values that have been successfully selected.

        Triggers a `change` and `input` event once all the provided options have been selected.

        **Usage**

        ```html
        <select multiple>
          <option value=\"red\">Red</option>
          <option value=\"green\">Green</option>
          <option value=\"blue\">Blue</option>
        </select>
        ```

        ```py
        # single selection matching the value or label
        element.select_option(\"blue\")
        # single selection matching the label
        element.select_option(label=\"blue\")
        # multiple selection for blue, red and second option
        element.select_option(value=[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"])
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : Union[Sequence[str], str, None]
            Options to select by value. If the `<select>` has the `multiple` attribute, all given options are selected,
            otherwise only the first option matching one of the passed options is selected. Optional.
        index : Union[Sequence[int], int, None]
            Options to select by index. Optional.
        label : Union[Sequence[str], str, None]

        **Details**

        This method taps the element by performing the following steps:
        1. Wait for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks on the element, unless `force` option is set.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.
        1. Use `page.touchscreen` to tap the center of the element, or the specified `position`.

        If the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        **NOTE** `element.tap()` requires that the `hasTouch` option of the browser context be set to true.

        Parameters
        ----------
        modifiers : Union[Sequence[Union["Alt", "Control", "ControlOrMeta", "Meta", "Shift"]], None]
            Modifier keys to press. Ensures that only these modifiers are pressed during the operation, and then restores
            current modifiers back. If not specified, currently pressed modifiers are used. "ControlOrMeta" resolves to
            "Control" on Windows and Linux and to "Meta" on macOS.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.

            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it. Note that keyboard
            `modifiers` will be pressed regardless of `trial` to allow testing elements which are only visible when those keys
            are pressed.

        Returns when element specified by locator satisfies the `state` option.

        If target element already satisfies the condition, the method returns immediately. Otherwise, waits for up to
        `timeout` milliseconds until the condition is met.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        order_sent = page.locator(\"#order-sent\")
        order_sent.wait_for()
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        state : Union["attached", "detached", "hidden", "visible", None]
            Defaults to `'visible'`. Can be either:
            - `'attached'` - wait for element to be present in DOM.
            - `'detached'` - wait for element to not be present in DOM.
            - `'visible'` - wait for element to have non-empty bounding box and no `visibility:hidden`. Note that element
              without any content or with `display:none` has an empty bounding box and is not considered visible.
            - `'hidden'` - wait for element to be either detached from DOM, or have an empty bounding box or
              `visibility:hidden`. This is opposite to the `'visible'` option.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        page.get_by_role(\"checkbox\").set_checked(True)
        ```

        **Details**

        This method checks or unchecks an element by performing the following steps:
        1. Ensure that matched element is a checkbox or a radio input. If not, this method throws.
        1. If the element already has the right checked state, this method returns immediately.
        1. Wait for [actionability](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability) checks on the matched element, unless `force` option is set. If
           the element is detached during the checks, the whole action is retried.
        1. Scroll the element into view if needed.
        1. Use `page.mouse` to click in the center of the element.
        1. Ensure that the element is now checked or unchecked. If not, this method throws.

        When all steps combined have not finished during the specified `timeout`, this method throws a `TimeoutError`.
        Passing zero timeout disables this.

        Parameters
        ----------
        checked : bool
            Whether to check or uncheck the checkbox.
        position : Union[{x: float, y: float}, None]
            A point to use relative to the top-left corner of element padding box. If not specified, uses some visible point of
            the element.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can
            be changed by using the `browser_context.set_default_timeout()` or `page.set_default_timeout()` methods.
        force : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to bypass the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks. Defaults to `false`.
        no_wait_after : Union[bool, None]
            This option has no effect.
            Deprecated: This option has no effect.
        trial : Union[bool, None]
            When set, this method only performs the [actionability](../actionability.md) checks and skips the action. Defaults
            to `false`. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.

        The method will automatically follow redirects.

        **Usage**

        JSON objects can be passed directly to the request:

        To send form data to the server use `form` option. Its value will be encoded into the request body with
        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding (see below how to use `multipart/form-data` form encoding to send
        files):

        ```python
        formData = {
            \"title\": \"Book Title\",
            \"body\": \"John Doe\",
        }
        api_request_context.post(\"https://example.com/api/findBook\", form=formData)
        ```

        The common way to send file(s) in the body of a request is to upload them as form fields with `multipart/form-data`
        encoding. Use `FormData` to construct request body and pass it to the request as `multipart` parameter:

        ```python
        api_request_context.post(
          \"https://example.com/api/uploadScript'\",
          multipart={
            \"fileField\": {
              \"name\": \"f.js\",
              \"mimeType\": \"text/javascript\",
              \"buffer\": b\"console.log(2022);\",
            },
          })

        Parameters
        ----------
        url_or_request : Union[Request, str]
            Target URL or Request to get all parameters from.
        params : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], str, None]
            Query parameters to be sent with the URL.
        method : Union[str, None]
            If set changes the fetch method (e.g. [PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) or
            [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST)). If not specified, GET method is used.
        headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            Allows to set HTTP headers. These headers will apply to the fetched request as well as any redirects initiated by
            it.
        data : Union[Any, bytes, str, None]
            Allows to set post data of the request. If the data parameter is an object, it will be serialized to json string
            and `content-type` header will be set to `application/json` if not explicitly set. Otherwise the `content-type`
            header will be set to `application/octet-stream` if not explicitly set.
        form : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, float, str]], None]
            Provides an object that will be serialized as html form using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding and sent
            as this request body. If this parameter is specified `content-type` header will be set to
            `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` unless explicitly provided.
        multipart : Union[Dict[str, Union[bool, bytes, float, str, {name: str, mimeType: str, buffer: bytes}]], None]
            Provides an object that will be serialized as html form using `multipart/form-data` encoding and sent as this
            request body. If this parameter is specified `content-type` header will be set to `multipart/form-data` unless
            explicitly provided. File values can be passed as file-like object containing file name, mime-type and its content.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Request timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.
        fail_on_status_code : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to throw on response codes other than 2xx and 3xx. By default response object is returned for all status
            codes.
        ignore_https_errors : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when sending network requests. Defaults to `false`.
        max_redirects : Union[int, None]
            Maximum number of request redirects that will be followed automatically. An error will be thrown if the number is
            exceeded. Defaults to `20`. Pass `0` to not follow redirects.
        max_retries : Union[int, None]
            Maximum number of times network errors should be retried. Currently only `ECONNRESET` error is retried. Does not
            retry based on HTTP response codes. An error will be thrown if the limit is exceeded. Defaults to `0` - no retries.

        ----------
        base_url : Union[str, None]
            Methods like `a_pi_request_context.get()` take the base URL into consideration by using the
            [`URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) constructor for building the corresponding URL.
            Examples:
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000` and sending request to `/bar.html` results in `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo/` and sending request to `./bar.html` results in
              `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html`
            - baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo` (without trailing slash) and navigating to `./bar.html` results in
              `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`
        extra_http_headers : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            An object containing additional HTTP headers to be sent with every request. Defaults to none.
        http_credentials : Union[{username: str, password: str, origin: Union[str, None], send: Union["always", "unauthorized", None]}, None]
            Credentials for [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). If no
            origin is specified, the username and password are sent to any servers upon unauthorized responses.
        ignore_https_errors : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when sending network requests. Defaults to `false`.
        proxy : Union[{server: str, bypass: Union[str, None], username: Union[str, None], password: Union[str, None]}, None]
            Network proxy settings.
        user_agent : Union[str, None]
            Specific user agent to use in this context.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the response. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable
            timeout.
        storage_state : Union[pathlib.Path, str, {cookies: Sequence[{name: str, value: str, domain: str, path: str, expires: float, httpOnly: bool, secure: bool, sameSite: Union["Lax", "None", "Strict"]}], origins: Sequence[{origin: str, localStorage: Sequence[{name: str, value: str}]}]}, None]
            Populates context with given storage state. This option can be used to initialize context with logged-in
            information obtained via `browser_context.storage_state()` or `a_pi_request_context.storage_state()`.
            Either a path to the file with saved storage, or the value returned by one of

            TLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.

            **Details**

            An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both `certPath` and `keyPath`,
            a single `pfxPath`, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (`cert` and `key`, or `pfx`). Optionally,
            `passphrase` property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The `origin` property should be provided
            with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.

            Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to
            reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an `origin` that
            does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.

            **NOTE** When using WebKit on macOS, accessing `localhost` will not pick up client certificates. You can make it
            work by replacing `localhost` with `local.playwright`.

        fail_on_status_code : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to throw on response codes other than 2xx and 3xx. By default response object is returned for all status
            codes.
        max_redirects : Union[int, None]
            Maximum number of request redirects that will be followed automatically. An error will be thrown if the number is
            exceeded. Defaults to `20`. Pass `0` to not follow redirects. This can be overwritten for each request
            individually.

        Ensures the `Locator` points to an element that contains the given text. All nested elements will be considered
        when computing the text content of the element. You can use regular expressions for the value as well.

        **Details**

        When `expected` parameter is a string, Playwright will normalize whitespaces and line breaks both in the actual
        text and in the expected string before matching. When regular expression is used, the actual text is matched as is.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        import re
        from playwright.sync_api import expect

        locator = page.locator('.title')
        expect(locator).to_contain_text(\"substring\")
        expect(locator).to_contain_text(re.compile(r\"\\d messages\"))
        ```

        If you pass an array as an expected value, the expectations are:
        1. Locator resolves to a list of elements.
        1. Elements from a **subset** of this list contain text from the expected array, respectively.
        1. The matching subset of elements has the same order as the expected array.
        1. Each text value from the expected array is matched by some element from the list.

        For example, consider the following list:

        ```html
        <ul>
          <li>Item Text 1</li>
          <li>Item Text 2</li>
          <li>Item Text 3</li>
        </ul>
        ```

        Let's see how we can use the assertion:

        ```py
        from playwright.sync_api import expect

        # ✓ Contains the right items in the right order
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_contain_text([\"Text 1\", \"Text 3\", \"Text 4\"])

        # ✖ Wrong order
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_contain_text([\"Text 3\", \"Text 2\"])

        # ✖ No item contains this text
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_contain_text([\"Some 33\"])

        # ✖ Locator points to the outer list element, not to the list items
        expect(page.locator(\"ul\")).to_contain_text([\"Text 3\"])
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        expected : Union[Pattern[str], Sequence[Pattern[str]], Sequence[Union[Pattern[str], str]], Sequence[str], str]
            Expected substring or RegExp or a list of those.
        use_inner_text : Union[bool, None]
            Whether to use `element.innerText` instead of `element.textContent` when retrieving DOM node text.
        timeout : Union[float, None]
            Time to retry the assertion for in milliseconds. Defaults to `5000`.
        ignore_case : Union[bool, None]

        Ensures the `Locator` points to an element with the given text. All nested elements will be considered when
        computing the text content of the element. You can use regular expressions for the value as well.

        **Details**

        When `expected` parameter is a string, Playwright will normalize whitespaces and line breaks both in the actual
        text and in the expected string before matching. When regular expression is used, the actual text is matched as is.

        **Usage**

        ```py
        import re
        from playwright.sync_api import expect

        locator = page.locator(\".title\")
        expect(locator).to_have_text(re.compile(r\"Welcome, Test User\"))
        expect(locator).to_have_text(re.compile(r\"Welcome, .*\"))
        ```

        If you pass an array as an expected value, the expectations are:
        1. Locator resolves to a list of elements.
        1. The number of elements equals the number of expected values in the array.
        1. Elements from the list have text matching expected array values, one by one, in order.

        For example, consider the following list:

        ```html
        <ul>
          <li>Text 1</li>
          <li>Text 2</li>
          <li>Text 3</li>
        </ul>
        ```

        Let's see how we can use the assertion:

        ```py
        from playwright.sync_api import expect

        # ✓ Has the right items in the right order
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_have_text([\"Text 1\", \"Text 2\", \"Text 3\"])

        # ✖ Wrong order
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_have_text([\"Text 3\", \"Text 2\", \"Text 1\"])

        # ✖ Last item does not match
        expect(page.locator(\"ul > li\")).to_have_text([\"Text 1\", \"Text 2\", \"Text\"])

        # ✖ Locator points to the outer list element, not to the list items
        expect(page.locator(\"ul\")).to_have_text([\"Text 1\", \"Text 2\", \"Text 3\"])
        ```

        ----------

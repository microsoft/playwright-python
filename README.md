Playwright is a powerful Python library to automate [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) browsers with a single API. Playwright delivers automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**. [See how Playwright is better](https://playwright.dev/python).

## üåü Key Features

- **Cross-browser**: Automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with the same API
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Cross-language**: Same API available in Python, JavaScript, .NET, and Java
- **Auto-waiting**: Automatically waits for elements to be ready
- **Mobile emulation**: Test responsive web apps with mobile device simulation
- **Network interception**: Capture and modify network requests
- **Reliable selectors**: Built-in support for text, CSS, XPath, and React selectors

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install Playwright
pip install playwright

# Install browser binaries (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
playwright install
```

### Your First Script

Create a file `example.py`:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Launch browser
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('https://playwright.dev')
        page.screenshot(path='example.png')
        print(f"Page title: {page.title()}")
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run your script:
```bash
python example.py
```

## üìö Examples

### Sync API

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    for browser_type in [p.chromium, p.firefox, p.webkit]:
        browser = browser_type.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('http://playwright.dev')
        page.screenshot(path=f'example-{browser_type.name}.png')
        print(f"Screenshot saved: example-{browser_type.name}.png")
        browser.close()
```

### Async API

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        for browser_type in [p.chromium, p.firefox, p.webkit]:
            browser = await browser_type.launch()
            page = await browser.new_page()
            await page.goto('http://playwright.dev')
            await page.screenshot(path=f'example-{browser_type.name}.png')
            print(f"Screenshot saved: example-{browser_type.name}.png")
            await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```
